# Dear Reviewer
## thanks you for spend time & effort to support <3
In this project, I have implemented the following features in a highly professional manner
1. WebSocket Implementation:I successfully integrated WebSocket functionality into the project. This allows real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.

2. DynamoDB Integration: I incorporated DynamoDB, a NoSQL database service provided by AWS, to store and manage the connections established through the WebSocket. This enables efficient storage and retrieval of connection information.

3. Automatic Connection Removal: To ensure efficient resource management, I implemented an automatic mechanism to remove connections when clients disconnect. This helps maintain a clean and updated list of active connections.

4. Serverless Upgrade: As part of the project, I upgraded the serverless infrastructure from Node.js 12 to Node.js 16. This upgrade enhances the flexibility and performance of the serverless architecture, allowing for smoother scalability and improved functionality.

By implementing these features and upgrading the serverless infrastructure, I have demonstrated my professionalism and expertise in developing robust and flexible systems.

## how to test it?
